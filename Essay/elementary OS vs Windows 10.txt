Kernel architecture {
	Linux {
		Kernel type:
			monolithic
		Scheduling support: 
			true preemptive multitasking (both in user mode and, since the 2.6 series, in kernel mode)
		Memory mapping:
			virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, memory management
		Networking support:
			TCP/IP
		Threading:
			1:1, i.e., user-mode threads correspond to kernel-mode threads
